## Getting Started

These packages are designed to make contributing as easy as possible. All work and planned features are tracked in the Issues.

If you'd like to contribute **claim an existing issue** -or- **create a new issue**. All unassigned issues are up-for-grabs.

Development follows the [Feature Branch Workflow][feature-workflow]:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch start with `feat|fix|chore|style|refactor` to be able publish `wc-toast` as canary release. For example: `feat/requestAnimationFrame` or `fix/glitch`
4. Implement your changes
5. Commit the changes
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to merge the changes
7. Reference the issue in the PR
